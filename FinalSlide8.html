    <p>Alright, now that we’ve got the pleasantries aside, let's get into why I despise this sandwich.</p>

    <p>First, let's talk the cheese. You know, the most important part of the sandwich. It’s your typical American Cheddar, but it’s never, never fully melted. Whenever I’ve gotten this sandwich, the cheese is still fully intact. Not cold, but not the golden, melty goodness you find in a homemade grilled cheese. It’s disappointing. It’s embarrassing. I get that Five Guys is a burger chain, but by that logic, you’d at least expect them to know how to melt cheese.</p>

        </div>

        <br>

    <div class="Intro2">
        <p>Now, the bread. Like Shake Shake, Five Guys uses the same bread they use for their burgers. Except, at Five Guys, this is a sesame seed bun. Sesame Seed. I don’t know about you, but when I’m biting into a grilled cheese, not only do I expect my cheese to be melted -- i’m not expecting to get a mouthful of sesame seeds. What the hell? It’s lazy. It takes away from the sandwich experience. It’s sad. Pair that with the unmelted cheese? A miserable disaster, I tell you.</p>

        <p>Now -- yes, there’s more -- would you believe me if I told you that this grilled cheese isn’t made with butter. Nope. They use mayo (via <a href= “https://www.reddit.com/r/grilledcheese/comments/4tk9w8/how_do_you_guys_go_about_cooking_a_grilled_cheese/”> reddit</a>). I don’t know about you, but when I make a grilled cheese, I want to do it right, and that means butter, not mayo. </p>

        <div class="Intro2">
            <p>The sandwich is also painfully, miserably small. With other fast food grilled cheeses, they had the excuse of being a kids menu item. Five Guys does not. I haven’t even begun to get into this damn sandwich’s <a href= “https://www.fiveguys.com/menu/Sandwiches”>nutritional information</a> -- but believe me, for what you get, it’s unfathomable to see how many calories, fat, and sodium is in this sandwich. For context, my brother has to get two of these to feel as though he had a meal. We can barely eat one without feeling bad though, knowing how much is in this tiny, minuscule excuse of a sandwich. I’m not saying other grilled cheeses are healthier (many of them are), but paired with the size? No. Just No.</p> 

            <p>One time, a friend of mine said they were getting a grilled cheese from Five Guys. This is what I wrote them:</p>

            <div class="Intro2">
                <p>I think this is a good place to end things, because if I kept going, we’d be here forever, and I’d get angrier. Overall: Do. Not. Get. The. Five. Guys. Grilled. Cheese.</p>

<p>If you have to get a fast food grilled cheese: Sonic. However, let’s be honest with ourselves, here: Butter, cheese, and bread.</p>

<p>Just make the damn sandwich at home. </p>
